// 3 Basic Principles of Responsive Design

// 1. Use Fluid Grids & Layouts
// To allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used to browse the website. Uses % rather than px for all layout related lengths.

// 2. Flexible/Responsive Images
// Images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that they also adapt nicely to the current viewport.

// 3. Media Queries
// To change styles on certain viewport widths (breakpoints), allowing us to create different versions of our website for different widths.
